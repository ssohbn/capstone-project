<h1> Electives are classes that all students have to take</h1>
<h2> Electives are an important part of school, and are very impactful for every student's future career</h2>
<br>
<p>Students pick these classes and often pick the class they will be more interested in, so it is important that everyone has the right electives available to them.</p>
<p>Having many elective choices keeps drop out rates lower, showing that they are beneficial. Many drop-outs classes courses because they are uninterested or unprepared for the course, so it is important that students have the right choices to take both an interesting class, and one that will prepare them for future courses that align with their interests. Electives are highly impactful on student's futures and decrease drop-out rates, so clearly, students need a way to easily take more electives. The obvious choice pushed to many students is to take online courses, or to take extracurriculars outside of school, though students doing these activities will still have to take elective classes, and these activities may be inaccessible to certain students, so students need schools to offer more to properly cater to student growth.</p>
