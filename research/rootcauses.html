<h1> Root cause thing</h1>
<br>
<h2> Students drop out because programming is hard to learn</h2>
<p>High dropout rate but using fun lego robots decreased dropout rate and increased flowchart and structure literacy in homework</p>
<br>
<p>When students aren’t having fun, they won't work as hard to learn a subject. Having the fun lego robots made students more willing to learn, decreased dropouts, and helped the students’ skills. The students were able to connect to computer science through the use of robots, allowing them to achieve greater things.</p>
<br>
<p>Fewer people want to major in cs over time, groups of people are noticing this and trying to get more people interested in cs</p>
<br>
<p>Students don’t want to do cs, so people are doing studies on making electives to increase interest in computers. </p>
<br>
<p>This implies that it is important that students connect to cs classes. Students need to be able to take classes that will teach them but also connect to previous and other experiences, so they can stay interested and willing to learn in cs.</p>
<br>
<h2> Current electives aren't supporting cs students enough</h2>
<br>
<p>Cs1 students think they’re bad at programming.</p>
<br>
<p>Cs1 is an intro course for computer science majors. If students are not confident in this course, it is likely that they were under prepared when entering the course. </p>
<br>
<p>Current electives aren’t preparing students enough, so they drop out.</p>
