<h1> case study thing</h1>
<br>
<p>i looked at a case study by https://www.cyberinnovationcenter.org who had an article i read on ieee</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Attempting to solve the issue is something that this case study does well.</p>
<p>Most organizations have not attempted to solve this issue, so it is good that this place is trying. I had lots of trouble searching for someone who was working on improving computer science electives so it is very important that this organization is trying to address the issue.</p>
<p>So far, technology is not being used much in this issue.</p>
<p>Using technology could help the way people are addressing the problem, but nobody is addressing it, which is the purpose of the case study. Technology could help to survey students for potential solutions. It could be used to find problematic classes and see where students need support.</p>
<p>Despite the small amount of data, students are doing better with cool electives. They are getting lower dropout rates and show a higher understanding of computer science.</p>
<p>The increased success could show that changing electives could help students but there is currently not enough data see if and what the problem is. The lack of data makes this problem hard to address so it is important to collect more information before attempting to make big changes. This data could be collected by creating a fun education opportunity and asking about their satisfaction with school before and after interacting with the new opportunity. ( the opportunity is a super computer )</p>
