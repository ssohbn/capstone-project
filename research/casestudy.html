<h1> case study thing</h1>
<br>
<p>i looked at a case study by https://www.cyberinnovationcenter.org who had an article i read on ieee</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Attempting to solve the issue is something that this case study does well.</p>
<p>Most organizations have not attempted to solve this issue, so it is good that this place is trying.</p>
<p>So far, technology is not being used much in this issue.</p>
<p>Using technology could help the way people are addressing the problem, but nobody is addressing it, which is the purpose of the case study. You cannot research data that does not exist.</p>
<p>Despite the small amount of data, students are doing better with cool electives. They are getting lower dropout rates and show a higher understanding of computer science.</p>
<p>This shows that creating new cooler electives works better than boring old ones</p>
